</span>

> Have you ever glanced at a public toilet but refrained from
> using it after noticing how unclean it is?
> Our project targets to change this perception about public
> toilets and create new norm about them!
> We have designed a website through which a user can spread
> awareness about where a public toilet is lacking.
> Our project will help the required authorities to maintain and
> repair the required public toilets based on the information
> gathered by our website, which has been taken from the users
> themselves.
> Our site also can be used as a gateway to locate public toilets
> near you and further provide feedback for the need of creation
> of new public toilets.
